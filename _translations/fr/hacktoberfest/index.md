# Pencil2D & Hacktoberfest
Every year we take this opportunity to welcome potential Pencil2D contributors and we thought it was a great idea to reward them for helping us to make Pencil2D better! As such we'll be taking part of this recurrent event in the foreseeable future.

We are greatly in need of human talent, specifically developers, but we also have tasks for people to participate in this event even if they do not know how to program. We have created specific guides for both of these groups of contributors to help people get started with Hacktoberfest.

# Contribution Guides
Please choose the appropriate guide for your skills if you are interested in contributing:
- [Guide for Developer Contributors]({{ translated_pages | where: "ref", "hacktoberfest_dev_guide" | map: "url" | first | relative_url }})
- [Guide for Non-Developer Contributors]({{ translated_pages | where: "ref", "hacktoberfest_alt_guide" | map: "url" | first | relative_url }})

> _Note: Pencil2D is not related or sponsored by Digital Ocean in any way. We are simply promoting their event which has a beneficial impact in the open-source community and should not be considered as corporate endorsement of any kind to our project._
