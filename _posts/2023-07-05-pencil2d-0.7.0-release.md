A much awaited re-designed camera system, timeline dragging and exposure improvements, adjustable layer opacity, repositioning content of multiple frames, perspective grids and more.

### Selection/Move tool improvements [#1724](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/1724)

It's been on our TODO list for a long time but this release is finally where we got around to fix one obnoxious problem about the move tool. The fact that when you rotate a selection, the selection visual itself doesn't change. Fixing this problem however required reworking a lot of the selection logic but doing so also allowed us to fix a bunch of other annoying bugs, while also being able to improve the user experience.


| Old                        | New                                              |
| ---------------------------|------------------------------------------------- |
|  ![selection-old](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io/assets/1045397/3177aeba-756e-44cd-b1ab-7fe59a93e91a)     |  ![selection-new](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io/assets/1045397/5569241b-3f99-4831-a2f9-68692dfff286) |

A few quality of life improvements that this gave birth to:

Previously when you had created a selection and moved your object without deselecting and wanting to change layer, you would get a blocking dialog, requiring you to deny or accept the current transformation.

<img width="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io/assets/1045397/924f9a04-b6ef-4949-a8bf-3eda888f7066">

Now because of the reworked logic, this is no longer neccesary and we can instead just apply the change immediately and change layer.

In addition to that every transform will also now be undo'able.

### Perspective grids! [#1352](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/1352)

### Windows Installer [#848](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/848)

On Windows, Pencil2D has traditionally been distributed as a simple self-contained ZIP archive. This has a number of advantages, such as minimal impact on the system configuration, simple removal once you no longer need the software or the ability to easily switch between different versions of Pencil2D.

However, we noticed that this method of distribution also caused a number of issues, particularly for non-technical users who are not familiar with it. Some did not know how to extract the file, others were confused by the lack of a dedicated uninstaller, and many were greeted by frustrating error messages concerning missing DLL files.

To address these issues, we're now providing an installer for Pencil2D, as many Windows users have come to expect from their programs. The installer will ensure that all the DLL files Pencil2D needs are available, file type associations and a start menu shortcut are set up correctly, and an uninstaller is available from the apps page in your system settings which allows you to easily remove Pencil2D when you no longer need it. Of course, the traditional ZIP files also continue to be available to those who prefer them!
