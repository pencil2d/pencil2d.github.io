# Pencil2D & Hacktoberfest
Every year we take this opportunity to welcome potential Pencil2D contributors and to reward them for helping us to make Pencil2D better we've decided to make a dedicated page to make this a recurrent event that our users and contributors can look forward to!

# Contribution Guides
We've created two guides to contributing to Pencil2D for Hacktoberfest, one for coders and one for everyone else looking to help. We have jobs from making new features and fixing bugs, to improving our website, to helping create the user documentation or translating and proofreading our application. Please check out one or both of these if you want to learn more:
