## <a id="#download"><a/>Pencil2D Release Version 0.6.5

It's been well over **1 year** since our last release. Many things have happened for all of us and even though we are still performing post-release tasks and fixing unforeseen bugs, we have persevered to get this version with **over 600+ individual tasks**. Thus we are releasing Pencil2D v0.6.5 into the wild!

[Download v0.6.5][0]!

## <a id="#intro"><a/>Pencil2D Release 0.6.5, 28 days later

...Well actually make that 40 *gasp*. Truth be told the application has been out since July 31st 2020. While we were working on a new release strategy the release version became more and more ambitious, however most of our team had a reality check with both their personal and professional lives so we had to decide that it was time to release a new, albeit impefect, version to update your experience.

The lack of a timely announcement was a byproduct of our desire that all platforms we support officially or through external maintainers were ready before the announcent. This time we also wanted to provide a bit more explanation on how the new features are used, so we produced a few video overviews to help with this.

We're still working though. Right now we're furiously addressing new bugs that have appeared due to the newest features, and finally putting to rest other issues that have been chasing us for years. We kindly ask everyone to please follow closely the bug tracker, as we will be also looking to release a new bug fix version, 0.6.6 by the end of september / start of october to address some of the most critical [Known issues](#known-issues) you'll find right off the bat.

Lastly, during this past year we've been also dealing with additional issues introduced by traditional operating systems, and after the new wave of security updates, the open-source community, as well as Pencil2D users have been reporting various issues related to file permissions. [If you'd like to know what we've done to ease this problem and what you can do, read on](#permissions)! 

Before you dive into the current [release notes](#release-notes) or the new [feature highligths](#highlights) [we have a surprise](#showcase) for everyone!

## <a id="#pclshowcase"><a/>Pencil2D User Showcase 2020

Back in May we made a call for content in order to update our **User Showcase** for 2020. Suffice to say we are overjoyed with the work that was sent and we're proud of this community. While we couldn't accomodate everyone, we did our best so each contributing artist would be featured and we edited the video artistically to higlight their own work. We hope you enjoy it!

We also took some time to provide quick video guides to each of the new major features that have landed in Pencil2D. While humble, these will certainly improve over time with your feedback and support. Enjoy!

## <a id="#permissions"><a/>Windows & MacOS Permissions Issues

Begining 2019 we started to have many reports about crashes and corrupted files (something we had managed to minimize with previous patches), after many months of investigation and support tickets, we narrowed down the root cause of these problems. It was the Operating Systems themselves.

Windows 10 and macOS Mojave, and later Catalina have been on a crusade to enhance their security protocols. While this is not a bad thing to do, when most software vendors are required a thorough scrutiny to even be able to get into an end user system, this quickly becomes a rbeeding ground for chaos.

Attempting to spare you from the technical details, put quite simply, Pencil2D was caught in the security mayhem and to be honest we still haven't found a suitable solution that can be bundled with the software.

With the recent Windows OS signed certification and macOS notarization buffs, we've found ourselves fighting for survival, so to speak.

To ease our affected users experience we have made and found a set of guides on how to deal with permissions & security lock-in for our software.

## <a id="#known-issues"><a/>Known Issues & Gotchas

Here is a non-exhaustive list of bugs that we are already aware of, but were unable to fix in this release. Rest assured, we will do our best to fix all of them eventually.

- [#1417] Panels spilling their content or timeline getting pushed outside the scree when the vertical screen size is too narrow, usually on 1366x768 laptops (this was partially addressed by #1369 already)
- [#1426] Onion skins, layers & documents show "ghosted" (buffered) images after creating a selection
- [#1427] Crash when importing multiple PCLX layers using the same dialog with the new Pencil2D project import feature
- [#1428] Crash when creating new file after using peg-bar alignment
- [#1429] Unoding a stroke made in an empty frame, relative to an existing keyframe will create a new keyframe instead and mess up the undo order.
- [#1433] & [#1435] Polyline tool drawing not updating properly while drawing on vector & bitmap layers respectively.

- Zooming out the camera layer to less than 25% will increase the chance of Crashing Pencil2D
- [#748](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/748), [#1004](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1004), [#1098](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1098) Misc undo/redo issues. **New Undo / Redo system under development** will be reviewed for v0.7.0
- [#1117](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1117) The CLI (Command-Line Interface) export operation consumes more memory than using the editor
- [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120) Undoing Selection Flip X / Y will delete the drawing instead. A possible fix will be available for the new undo system.
- [#1133](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1133) Lag and buggy strokes with Huion tablets. Workaround: disabling the "linear optimizer" in your tablet driver may help if that option is available, see [this post](https://discuss.pencil2d.org/t/difficulty-with-tablet/1369/9?u
- [#1179](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1179) Currently there's an audio delay of 1-2 frames for in-editor playback & exported files. However on some systems the opposite happens where the audio delay on playback might be longer by 12-16 or more frames, but on export it works ok.
- [#1189](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1189) Zoom shortcut on drawing tools not working properly with the Middle Mouse Button (Win) and mouse input in general (All Operating Systems)
- [#1193](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1193) The feather slider widget (Brush Tool) has a higher max value than the input value, and any value above 96 pixels will not allow you to paint.
- [#1196](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1196) A unerasable stroke appears when drawing if you turn off the pressure sensitivity checkbox with drawing tools.
- [#943](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/943) Color Palette (Bitmap): Some issues when replacing the first swatch remain. Only thumbnail changes color, but the actual color doesn't. It is recommended you make a new item rather than changing it.
- [#1055](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1055) Color Palette (Bitmap): Swatches will not update using the Replace command. It only works when having a vector layer active. (Note: Create your custom palettes with a vector layer selected or import them from GIMP or Krita using *.gpl files)

- Undo: Undoing a stroke made on an empty frame creates a keyframe on that frame.
- Undo: Undoing moving a keyframe to a new frame will create a blank keyframe on the place where it used to be.
- Undo, Smudge Tool (Bitmap): You cannot UNDO the smudge tool at the moment.
- Blur Tool (Bitmap): Pressing ALT with smudge tool doesn’t work, do NOT use it. Use other drawing apps for smudge or blur effects for now.
- Fill Tool (Vector): Filling a stroke requires the stroke to be selected.
- Fill Tool (Vector): "Stroke thickness" option will reset pressure sensitive lines width.
- In general the Vector Engine is a WIP or not working as intended. Much more work will be required, please avoid using it.

## <a id="#helpus"><a/>How can I help?

In case you missed our announcement on social media, now you can upload your Pencil2D project [here](https://www.pencil2d.org/contribute/share.html) to help Pencil2D development.

With a project library, our dev team will be able to test new features and detect bugs more effectively. We are still looking for more projects from our users so please consider sharing them with us if you have any. The projects are invaluable to us even if you just share them privately.

To those who have already shared your work with us, we are very grateful for your help. Some of the fixes in this very release would not have been possible without you.

Pencil2D is developed by passionate volunteers in their spare time. You can become one too, there are many ways to help other than programming! Please visit [Contribute Page](https://www.pencil2d.org/contribute/) for further information.
