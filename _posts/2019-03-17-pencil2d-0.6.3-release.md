After 6 months of work, we're finally ready to wrap up the version 0.6.3 with new features, enhancements and bug fixes that have been worked on by the community. [Please download it here][0] and enjoy animating.

Many of these fixes and enhancements were made possible by contributors around the world that learned of our project through the [#Hacktoberfest2018](https://www.pencil2d.org/2018/10/hacktoberfest-pencil2d.html) event sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [Github](https://github.com)

To everyone that contributed and made this release possible. Thank you!

## Flipping / Rolling
[#978](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/978) (by [David Lamhauge][david])

Flipping & Rolling are two techniques that allow animators to quickly preview their animation work.

Flipping is used mostly for the process known as in-betweening with 3 drawings. By pressing `Alt+Z`, you can glance through the first drawing (previous key), the last drawing (next key) and the currently edited inbetween.

Rolling technique is used to check a specific part of the action of the animation. By pressing `Alt+X`, you can preview 5 drawings in ordered sequence flipping with all your available fingers.

## Known Issues

While there seems to be a growing list of Know issues, make no mistake, we are working hard on reviewing and fixing them as thoroughly as possible, and with this release you'll notice plenty of improvements on key areas so don't worry!

- [#748](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/748), [#1004](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1004), [#1098](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1098), [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120), [#1170](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1170) Miscellaneous undo/redo issues. Should hopefully be fixed in v0.6.5.
- [#940](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/940) project is corrupted because comma is used as decimal separator in some countries instead of period. Some fixes were applied, but the issue is persisting.
- [#1033](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1033) Sound import and playback does not work with the Linux AppImage. Workaround: use [flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.pencil2d.Pencil2D) or your distro package manager (if it offers the latest version).
- [#1117](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1117) The CLI (Command-Line Interface) export operation consumes more memory than exporting from within the editor itself.
- [#1019](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1019) The program may crash or erase selection content when using the `ALT + TAB / APPLE + TAB / SHIFT + TAB` shortcut.
- [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120) Undoing Selection Flip X / Y will delete the drawing instead.
- [#1133](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1133) Lag and buggy strokes with Huion tablets. Workaround: disabling the "linear optimizer" in your tablet driver may help if that option is available, see [this post](https://discuss.pencil2d.org/t/difficulty-with-tablet/1369/9?u=scribblemaniac).
- [#1174](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1174) Inconsistent palette import behavior: Depending on which palette file format is used, the new palette may append or overwrite the existing palette.
- [#1177](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1177) Imported image position is modified by the canvas view center
- [#1179](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1179) Currently there's an audio delay of 1-2 frames for in-editor playback & exported files. However on some systems the opposite happens where the audio delay on playback might be longer by 12-16 or more frames, but on export it works ok.
- [#1186](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1186) Quick Sizing is enabled on Paint Bucket Tool, but does nothing.
- [#1189](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1189) Zoom shortcut on drawing tools not working properly with the Middle Mouse Button (Win) and mouse input in general (macOS)
- [#1192](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1192) When using the flipping & rolling feature, if you quickly try to drag the scrub header when the action occurs, Pencil2D will crash. (there is a fix already awaiting approval)
- [#1193](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1193) The feather slider widget (Brush Tool) has a higher max value than the input value, and any value above 96 pixels will not allow you to paint.
- [#1195](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1195) The update check prompts an error because there is currently no other update to get
- [#1196](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1196) A unerasable stroke appears when drawing if you turn off the pressure sensitivity checkbox with drawing tools.
- Playing back audio from any frame other than the first will slightly off-sync the audio in the editor. For now we recommend playing back sounds from the beginning and gauging the sound particularly for lipsync or musicalized action. Afterwards check your output with a dedicated video editor to avoid sync issues.
- Color Palette (Bitmap): First Swatch is unchangeable. Can’t use replace command. Use the other swatches to create your own colors or change it by editing the palette in a vector layer or via XML.
- Color Palette (Bitmap): Swatches will only update using the Replace command when having a vector layer active. (Note: Create your custom palettes with a vector layer selected)
- Selection Tool (Rotation): Using the SELECT ALL command (CTRL + A) and rotating a selection, will store the rotation transformation, if you create a selection and click on the drawing with the MOVE TOOL, it will rotate the selection again. Despite possible use cases this is a bug.
- Undo: Undoing a drawing modification made on an empty frame creates a keyframe on that frame.
- Undo: Undoing moving a keyframe to a new frame will create a blank keyframe on the place where it used to be.
- Undo, Smudge Tool (Bitmap): You cannot UNDO the smudge tool at the moment.
- Blur Tool (Bitmap): Pressing ALT with smudge tool doesn’t work, do not use it. Use other drawing apps for smudge effects.
- Fill Tool (Vector): Filling a stroke requires the stroke to be selected.
- Fill Tool (Vector): “stroke thickness” option will reset pressure sensitive lines width.
- In general the Vector Engine is a WIP or not working as intended. Much more work will be required, please don't use it.
