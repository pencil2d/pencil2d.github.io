## <a id="#download"><a/>Pencil2D Release Version 0.6.5

It's been well over **1 year** since our last release. Many things have happened for all of us and even though we are still performing post-release tasks, we have persevered to get this version with **over 600+ individual tasks**. Thus we are releasing Pencil2D v0.6.5 into the wild!

[Download v0.6.5][0]!

## <a id="#intro"><a/>Pencil2D Release 0.6.5

Truth be told we were attempting a new release strategy, but during this experimental phase the version release became more and more ambitious for a proper "feature release", and we realized this as we tried to push for compatibility breaking changes, however most of our team had a reality check in both their personal and professional lives and we had to decide that it was time to release a new Pencil2D version to update your experience.

During this past year unfortunately we've been dealing with additional issues on each of our beloved operating systems, and since their latest iterations a new wave of security lock-in's have been appearing, typical of proprietary vendors, which has caused a lot of trouble for the open-source community as well as Pencil2D users, as they can't circumvent these "features" due to lacking administration rights for their systems. [If you'd like to know what we've done and what you can do, read on](#permissions)! but before you get into the release notes highlighs [we have a surprise](#showcase) for everyone!

## <a id="#pclshowcase"><a/>Pencil2D User Showcase 2020

During May we made a call for content in order to update our **User Showcase** for 2020. Suffice to say we are overjoyed with the work that was sent and we're proud of this community. While we couldn't accomodate everyone, we did our best so each contributing artist would be featured and we edited the video to higlight their work. We hope you enjoy it

## <a id="#permissions"><a/>Windows & MacOS Permissions Issues

Begining 2019 we started to have many reports about crashes and corrupted files (something we had managed to minimize with previous patches), after many months of investigation and support tickets, we narrowed down the root cause of these problems. It was the Operating Systems themselves.

Windows 10 and macOS Mojave, and later Catalina have been on a crusade to enhance their security protocols. While this is not a bad thing to do, when most software vendors are required a thorough scrutiny to even be able to get into an end user system, this quickly becomes a rbeeding ground for chaos.

Attempting to spare you from the technical details, put quite simply, Pencil2D was caught in the security mayhem and to be honest we still haven't found a suitable solution that can be bundled with the software.

With the recent Windows OS signed certification and macOS notarization buffs, we've found ourselves fighting for survival, so to speak.

To ease our affected users experience we have made and found a set of guides on how to deal with permissions & security lock-in for our software.

## <a id="#known-issues"><a/>Known Issues & Gotchas

Here is a non-exhaustive list of bugs that we are already aware of, but were unable to fix in this release. Rest assured, we will do our best to fix all of them eventually.

- Zooming out the camera layer to less than 25% will increase the chance of Crashing Pencil2D
- [#748](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/748), [#1004](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1004), [#1098](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1098) Misc undo/redo issues. **New Undo / Redo system under development** will be reviewed for v0.7.0
- [#1117](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1117) The CLI (Command-Line Interface) export operation consumes more memory than using the editor
- [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120) Undoing Selection Flip X / Y will delete the drawing instead. A possible fix will be available for the new undo system.
- [#1133](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1133) Lag and buggy strokes with Huion tablets. Workaround: disabling the "linear optimizer" in your tablet driver may help if that option is available, see [this post](https://discuss.pencil2d.org/t/difficulty-with-tablet/1369/9?u
- [#1179](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1179) Currently there's an audio delay of 1-2 frames for in-editor playback & exported files. However on some systems the opposite happens where the audio delay on playback might be longer by 12-16 or more frames, but on export it works ok.
- [#1189](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1189) Zoom shortcut on drawing tools not working properly with the Middle Mouse Button (Win) and mouse input in general (All Operating Systems)
- [#1193](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1193) The feather slider widget (Brush Tool) has a higher max value than the input value, and any value above 96 pixels will not allow you to paint.
- [#1196](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1196) A unerasable stroke appears when drawing if you turn off the pressure sensitivity checkbox with drawing tools.
- [#943](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/943) Color Palette (Bitmap): Some issues when replacing the first swatch remain. Only thumbnail changes color, but the actual color doesn't. It is recommended you make a new item rather than changing it.
- [#1055](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1055) Color Palette (Bitmap): Swatches will not update using the Replace command. It only works when having a vector layer active. (Note: Create your custom palettes with a vector layer selected or import them from GIMP or Krita using *.gpl files)

- Undo: Undoing a stroke made on an empty frame creates a keyframe on that frame.
- Undo: Undoing moving a keyframe to a new frame will create a blank keyframe on the place where it used to be.
- Undo, Smudge Tool (Bitmap): You cannot UNDO the smudge tool at the moment.
- Blur Tool (Bitmap): Pressing ALT with smudge tool doesn’t work, do NOT use it. Use other drawing apps for smudge or blur effects for now.
- Fill Tool (Vector): Filling a stroke requires the stroke to be selected.
- Fill Tool (Vector): "Stroke thickness" option will reset pressure sensitive lines width.
- In general the Vector Engine is a WIP or not working as intended. Much more work will be required, please avoid using it.

## <a id="#helpus"><a/>How can I help?

In case you missed our announcement on social media, now you can upload your Pencil2D project [here](https://www.pencil2d.org/contribute/share.html) to help Pencil2D development.

With a project library, our dev team will be able to test new features and detect bugs more effectively. We are still looking for more projects from our users so please consider sharing them with us if you have any. The projects are invaluable to us even if you just share them privately.

To those who have already shared your work with us, we are very grateful for your help. Some of the fixes in this very release would not have been possible without you.

Pencil2D is developed by passionate volunteers in their spare time. You can become one too, there are many ways to help other than programming! Please visit [Contribute Page](https://www.pencil2d.org/contribute/) for further information.
