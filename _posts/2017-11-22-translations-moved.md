The translation platform of Pencil2D has moved to **[Transifex][0]**. From now on, all work on translations will happen there. You can still access to the old [OneSky project][1] but it will no longer be maintained and updated.

Visit our new translation project: <https://www.transifex.com/pencil2d/pencil2d/>

We believe that moving to Transifex will make the translation work easier. It has glossary and concordance search, also a lot of open source projects are using it. 

If you want to contribute to a translation, all you have to do is sign up on Transifex, request to join the team and start translating. 

Thanks again to all our generous volunteer translators.

Hope to hear from you guys soon!
