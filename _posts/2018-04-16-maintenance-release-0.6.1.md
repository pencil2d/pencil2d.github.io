We are excited to announce our first maintenance release after v0.6 with dozens of bug fixes and improvements. Please go to our [Download Page](https://pencil2d.org/download) and download the new version.

## What's new in v0.6.1

Although it is a maintenance release but still something to be excited about. With Pencil2D v.6.1, you will get a better, faster, lighter Pencil2D in many aspects. Here are some of the highlights of this release:

## Pencil2D as a brand

While we have smashed numerous bugs, improved and added several new features, we also decided to give the original Pencil2D a facelift.

Since our project is a fork of the old Pencil animation drawing project by **Pascal Naidon**, we decided that it was time to change the appearance of Pencil2D, make it feel like it truly belongs to us.

In that sense we've given the icon a needed facelift, making it both stand out from any other application, while also retaining the look of the old icon.

## Shiny new tool icons!

## Speeding up Movie exporting

Exporting movie is blazing fast now. Exporting a 1321-frame project to mp4 was taking **42.7 seconds** but only **8.5 seconds** in v0.6.1. Similarly, GIF exporting time goes down from **53.8 secs** to **17.6 secs**.

## Lowering Memory Usage

We heard some of our users said, Pencil2D became very unstable when they created more than 700 frames. This is probably casued by high memory usage and we decided to improve it.

As a result, a 1321-frame project which used **1.8GB RAM** in v0.6 now never takes more than **400MB RAM**. We hope this change could bring you better experiences on low-end devices.

## Faster Project Load/Save

In this new version, Pencil2D takes much less time to save/load projects. On the loading side, Pencil2D loads only a few key frames at beginning so you can start animating without waiting for all frames to load at once. On the saving side, Pencil2D saves edited frames only and skips those unchanged frames. It will make a big difference when you are working on a large project with hundreds of frames.

Also we hope this change can make the "auto-save" feature less annoying and doesn't let it interrupt you from animating too long.
